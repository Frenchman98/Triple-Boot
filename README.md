# MSI GS65 Stealth Thin Triple Boot

Resources and guide for triple booting Windows 10, Elementary OS, and macOS 10.15 Catalina on an MSI GS65 Stealth Thin 8RF laptop.

It's assumed that the base operating system on the laptop is a recent version of Windows 10.

### Note:
My current hardware (only listing important differences between GS65 models) is:
- 2x 1TB NVMes (Opened up laptop and removed 512 GB M.2 SSD to install them)
- NVidia GeForce 1070 8GB with Max-Q Design
- 16 GB stock RAM

Having 2 hard drives simplifies the process, I will not be covering this installation when only a single hard drive is available
